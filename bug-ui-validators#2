Delegation after previous undelegation is not possible.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to https://app.arablefi.com/
2. Click on Validators
3. Delegate with any validator
4. Undelegate with the same validator
5. Try to delegate again with the same validator
6. Deletgation fails, because the `Delegate` button stays disabled.
