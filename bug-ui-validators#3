This bug is possibly related to bug-ui-validators#1 and/or bug-ui-validators#2

When trying to delegate I have had the issue where I would approve ACRE, then modal disappears without giving me
the chance to click on `Delegate`. Trying to delegate again fails, the delegate button stays deactivated.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to https://app.arablefi.com/
2. Click on `Validators`.
3. Click on `Delegate`.
4. Enter staking value.
5. Click `Approve ACRE`.
6. Confirm transaction MetaMask.
7. This modal disappears.
8. When trying to Delegate again with the same validator `Delegate` button stays disabled.
